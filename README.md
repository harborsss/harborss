- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Haley!! 

I'm currently a second-year CS major at university, so I've still got a lot left to learn. 

In the future I would be interested in games development, as well as working on creative software. In particular, I would love
to build programs for hobbyist creatives that are more intuitive and affordable than current those that are the current industry standard.
