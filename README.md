- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Haley!! :^)  

I'm currently a second-year CS major at university, so I've still got a lot left to learn! 

In the future I would be interested in games development, as well as developing creative software. In particular, I would love
to build software for hobbyist creatives that is more affordable and intuitive than the programs that are currently industry standards.
